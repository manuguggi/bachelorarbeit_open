# Bachelorarbeit: Analyse-Dashboard mybuxi

This project was created as part of my bachelor thesis during my studies in Mobility, Data Science & Economics at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences. The main goal of the thesis was to create an analytics dashboard for mybuxi. Mybuxi is a Swiss-based provider of demand responsive transportation (DRT). In addition to this, it was also intended to develop a forecast model for the same company.  

More details can be found in the thesis paper itself: ...


## Structure of this repository
As you can see in the short introduction, the project consists of 2 main themes with coding parts.

### 1. Dashboard
This folder contains all the code of the mybuxi-Dashboard. The dashboard was created using the Flask web framework.

*Note: The "data" folder contains the trip data of all mybuxi trips. In order to make the work public, these files have been removed and replaced with sample files*
